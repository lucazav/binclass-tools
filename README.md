A set of Python wrappers and interactive plots that facilitate the analysis of binary classification problems.

---

The __binclass-tools__ package makes the following available to you:

* Powerful interactive charts that simplify the analysis of a binary classifier's performance, including any amounts and costs associated with individual observations.

* A set of functions that return the values of metrics useful for measuring the performance of a binary classifier, for each threshold value if dependent on it.

* A set of functions to find the optimal threshold value calculated on both the most popular metrics associated with the binary classifier under analysis, and any costs associated with each of the 4 categories in the confusion matrix.

* A set of generic wrappers that help the analyst in daily operations dealing with binary classifications.

On [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/) you will find the following article describing the theory behind all the functions of the package and the path that led me to create a package for analyzing binary classifications that also included calculating optimal threshold values for specific metrics:

[Finding the Best Classification Threshold for Imbalanced Classifications with the Interactive Confusion Matrix and Line Charts]()

## Quick Start

### Requirements and Installation

The project is based on:
* Python 3.6+
* A set of the most popular packages used for working with data
* Plotly for interactive plots

If you do not have Python, install it first. Then, in your favorite conda or virtual environment, simply do:

```
pip install binclass-tools
```

or, if you want to install the development version directly from github:


```
pip install git+https://github.com/lucazav/binclass-tools
```

### Example Usage

Let's import both the usual libraries needed to work with the data and the binclass-tools one:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import bctools as bc
```

In addition, since we will train a classifier on randomly generated data via RandomForest, let's also import some useful functions for the purpose:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
```

Let's then train our model that we will use as a classifier to analyse thanks to the functions of _binclass-tools_:

```python
# Generate a binary imbalanced classification problem, with 80% zeros and 20% ones.
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20,
                           n_informative=14, n_redundant=0,
                           random_state=12, shuffle=False, weights = [0.8, 0.2])

# Train - test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.2, stratify = y, random_state=0)

# Train a RF classifier
cls = RandomForestClassifier(max_depth=6, oob_score=True)
cls.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Having trained the model, let's calculate the estimated probabilities of the predictions obtained from the training and testing datasets:

```python
# Get prediction probabilities for the train set
train_predicted_proba = cls.predict_proba(X_train)[:,1]

# Get prediction probabilities for the test set
test_predicted_proba = cls.predict_proba(X_test)[:,1] 
```

Let's also set up a set of variables to pass as parameters in the subsequent binclass-tools functions we will use. Considering that we are going to do first an analysis of how the model performs on the training dataset in order to get also the optimal threshold values, these are the variables we will calculate:

* The size of the step separating one threshold value from the other (always considering the extremes 0 and 1 inclusive).

* The list of individual amounts associated with each of the observables in the test dataset (since the dataset is generated by random values, the absolute value of column 13 is considered as the amount column).

* Which metrics to calculate the optimal threshold for (in our case all of them).

* Which currency symbol to use.

* The dictionary of costs associated with each of the 4 categories of the confusion matrix. It is possible to associate a single numerical value to be considered as the average cost for each observation in that category, or a list of values to be associated with each observation. Clearly, the length of the lists in the dictionary must all be the same length, equal to the number of observations in the dataset under analysis (in our case the test dataset).

Specifically, you have this:

```python
# set params for the train dataset
threshold_step = 0.05
amounts = np.abs(X_train[:, 13])
optimize_threshold = 'all'
currency = '$'

# The function get_cost_dict can be used to define the dictionary of costs.
# It takes as input, for each class, a float or a list of floats. 
# Lists must have coherent lenghts 

train_cost_dict = bc.get_cost_dict(TN = 0, FP = 10, FN = np.abs(X_train[:, 12]), TP = 0)
```

At this point we can visualize the _Interactive Confusion Matrix_ on the training dataset, including the optimal threshold for all the available metrics:

```python
var_metrics_df, invar_metrics_df, opt_thresh_df = bc.confusion_matrix_plot(
    true_y = y_train, 
    predicted_proba = train_predicted_proba, 
    threshold_step = threshold_step, 
    amounts = amounts, 
    cost_dict = train_cost_dict, 
    optimize_threshold = optimize_threshold, 
    #N_subsets = 70, subsets_size = 0.2, # default
    #with_replacement = False,           # default
    currency = currency,
    random_state = 123,
    title = 'Interactive Confusion Matrix for the Training Set');
```

Here the output:

![Interactive Confusion Matrix for the Training Set](/resources/images/01-interactive-confusion-matrix-train.png)

As you can see, the interactive confusion matrix plot also returns metric dataframes that can be used in your code if needed. One is the _threshold dependent metrics dataframe_:

The second is the _threshold invariant metrics dataframe_:

|    | invariant_metric   |   value |
|---:|:-------------------|--------:|
|  0 | roc_auc            |  0.9992 |
|  1 | pr_auc             |  0.9972 |
|  2 | brier_score        |  0.0427 |

The third and last one is a dataframe containing the _optimal threshold values_ for each implemented metric:

|    | optimized_metric   |   optimal_threshold |
|---:|:-------------------|--------------------:|
|  0 | kappa              |                0.3  |
|  1 | mcc                |                0.3  |
|  2 | roc                |                0.25 |
|  3 | f1_score           |                0.3  |
|  4 | f2_score           |                0.25 |
|  5 | f05_score          |                0.35 |
|  6 | cost               |                0.35 |

We borrowed the code for calculating optimal threshold values directly from the [GHOST repository](https://github.com/rinikerlab/GHOST), introducing more metrics and optimizing the calculations using parallelism.

Once the threshold values of interest have been identified through the training data, the Interactive Confusion Matrix can be plotted for the testing dataset. Here we also avoid calculating the optimal thresholds, since it does not make sense to do so on a testing dataset:

```python
# You can also analyze the test dataset.
# In this case there is no need to optimize the threshold value for any measure.
threshold_step = 0.05
amounts = np.abs(X_test[:, 13])
optimize_threshold = None
currency = '$'

test_cost_dict = bc.get_cost_dict(TN = 0, FP = 10, FN = np.abs(X_test[:, 12]), TP = 0)

var_metrics_df, invar_metrics_df, __ = bc.confusion_matrix_plot(
    true_y = y_test, 
    predicted_proba = test_predicted_proba, 
    threshold_step = threshold_step, 
    amounts = amounts, 
    cost_dict = test_cost_dict, 
    optimize_threshold = optimize_threshold, 
    #N_subsets = 70, subsets_size = 0.2, # default
    #with_replacement = False,           # default
    currency = currency,
    random_state = 123);
```

Evidently, the Interactive Confusion Matrix plot will not present the table of optimal threshold values for the various metrics:

![Interactive Confusion Matrix for the Training Set](/resources/images/02-interactive-confusion-matrix-test.png)

As you can see from the code, this time the dataframes returned are only the first two.

Should you need to have only the above dataframes available without generating the interactive confusion matrix plot, there are functions available specifically for this. You can get the threshold invariant metrics dataframe as following:

```python
invar_metrics_df = bc.utilities.get_invariant_metrics_df(true_y = y_test, 
                                      predicted_proba = test_predicted_proba)
```

You can also get the threshold dependent metrics dataframe and the confusion matrix values for a specific threshold as following:

```python
conf_matrix, metrics_fixed_thresh_df = bc.utilities.get_confusion_matrix_and_metrics_df(
    true_y = y_test, 
    predicted_proba = test_predicted_proba,
    threshold = 0.3 # default = 0.5
)
```

Keep in mind that the confusion matrix values are returned in an array, not in a dataframe.

Finally, the dataframe of the optimized thresholds can be also obtained directly with the following code:

```python
threshold_values = np.arange(0.05, 1, 0.05)

opt_thresh_df = bc.thresholds.get_optimized_thresholds_df(
    optimize_threshold = ['Kappa', 'Fscore', 'Cost'], 
    threshold_values = threshold_values, 
    true_y = y_train, 
    predicted_proba = train_predicted_proba,
    cost_dict = train_cost_dict, 
    
    # GHOST parameters (these values are also the default ones)
    N_subsets = 70,
    subsets_size = 0.2,
    with_replacement = False,
    
    random_state = 120)

```

The `N_subset`, `subset_size`, and `with_replacement` parameters are specific to the GHOST algorithm used to find the optimal threshold values. For more details, you can refer directly to the [paper introducing the GHOST method](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.1c00160).

If, on the other hand, you are interested in specifically optimizing a non-cost-based threshold (specifically, one of these: 'ROC', 'MCC', 'Kappa', 'F1'), you can use the following function:

```python
opt_roc_threshold_value = bc.thresholds.get_optimal_threshold(
    y_train, 
    train_predicted_proba, 
    threshold_values,
    ThOpt_metrics = 'ROC', # default = 'Kappa'

    # GHOST parameters (these values are also the default ones) 
    N_subsets = 70,
    subsets_size = 0.2,
    with_replacement = False,

    random_seed = 120)
```

Keep in mind that if you choose _'Fscore'_ as the metric to optimize, you will be returned 3 optimal threshold values for metrics F1, F2 and F0.5 respectively.

Specifically for cost optimization (minimization), you can use the following function:

```python
opt_cost_threshold_value = bc.thresholds.get_cost_optimal_threshold(
    y_train, 
    train_predicted_proba, 
    cost_dict = train_cost_dict,

    # GHOST parameters (these values are also the default ones) 
    N_subsets = 70,
    subsets_size = 0.2,
    with_replacement = False,

    random_seed = 120)
```

You could also be also interested in visualizing the trend of possible amounts or costs associated with each category of the confusion matrix as the threshold value changes. For this purpose there is the following function that generates an _Interactive Confusion Line Chart_:

```python
amount_cost_df, total_amount = bc.confusion_linechart_plot(
    true_y = y_test, 
    predicted_proba = test_predicted_proba, 
    threshold_step =  threshold_step, 
    amounts = amounts, 
    cost_dict = test_cost_dict, 
    currency = currency);
```

Here the output:

![Interactive Confusion Line Chart](/resources/images/03-interactive-confusion-line-chart.png)

You can see that there are also black "diamonds" indicating the first threshold value in which there is a swap of the amount and cost curves. The curve swapping points can also be more than one.

This function, in addition to generating the plot, also returns two output values: the total amount given by the sum of all categories and the dataframe of the amounts and costs for each category as the threshold changes:

```python
print(f'total amount: {currency}{total_amount}')

amount_cost_df 
```

In addition to the result of the total amount ($374.24), here the amounts & costs dataframe:

|    |   threshold |   amount_TN |   amount_FP |   amount_FN |   amount_TP |   cost_TN |   cost_FP |   cost_FN |   cost_TP |   total_cost |

Just as we have already seen with the other plots, the amount and cost dataframe can be obtained directly through a specific function. In particular, you can also choose not to report amounts, for example, if you only want to analyze costs:

```python
# this function requires a list of thresholds, instead of the step, for example:
threshold_values = np.arange(0, 1, 0.05)

# example without amounts
costs_df = bc.utilities.get_amount_cost_df(
    true_y = y_test, 
    predicted_proba = test_predicted_proba,
    threshold_values = threshold_values, 
    #amounts = amounts,  
    cost_dict = test_cost_dict)
```

It may be sometimes necessary to compare the performance of what is considered a gain (e.g., amount of TP because it escaped fraud) with what is considered a loss (amount of FN of fraud escaped from the model + fixed cost per FP representing the checking to be done on transactions that are classified as fraudulent but are not). This can be done through the _Interactive Amount-Cost Line Chart_:

```python
amount_classes = ['TP', 'FP'] 
cost_classes = 'all'

total_cost_amount_df = bc.total_amount_cost_plot(
    true_y = y_test, 
    predicted_proba = test_predicted_proba, 
    threshold_step = threshold_step,
    amounts = amounts, 
    cost_dict = test_cost_dict,
    amount_classes = amount_classes,
    cost_classes = cost_classes,
    currency = currency);
```

Here the resulting plot:

As in the other cases, this function returns a dataframe with the amount and cost values, both for each category in the confusion matrix and for selected aggregates of them, associated with each threshold:

|    |   threshold |   amount_TP |   amount_FP |   amount_sum |   cost_TN |   cost_FP |   cost_FN |   cost_TP |   cost_sum |

You can also directly access the previous data with the already used `get_amount_cost_df()` function, excluding for example amounts to focus on costs:

```python
# this function requires a list of thresholds, instead of the step, for example:
threshold_values = np.arange(0, 1, 0.05)

# example without amounts
costs_df = bc.utilities.get_amount_cost_df(
    true_y = y_test, 
    predicted_proba = test_predicted_proba,
    threshold_values = threshold_values, 
    #amounts = amounts,  
    cost_dict = test_cost_dict)
```

Finally, there is also a function in this first release that simplifies the extraction of observations belonging to a specific category of the confusion matrix from a scored dataframe. If you want to extract, for example, all observations belonging to the TP category, this is the code you need:

```python
# for example, if we want the True Positive data points with a 0.7 threshold:
confusion_category = 'TP'

bc.get_confusion_category_observations_df(
    confusion_category = confusion_category, 
    X_data = X_test, 
    true_y = y_test, 
    predicted_proba = test_predicted_proba, 
    threshold = 0.7 # default = 0.5
)
```
